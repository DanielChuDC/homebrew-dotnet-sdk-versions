# The reason why we do not simply run `brew cask ci` is because the task 
# will complain and fail if we do not remove all installed sub-packages during `uninstall`.
# However, we should not remove the sub-packages because they are the shared runtime between
# different versions and the other parallelly installed versions will fail to run if we 
# remove them.
